  The CircleCI command orb installs datadog-ci and uses the `datadog-ci synthetics run-tests` command to execute Datadog Synthetics tests.
# What will your orb allow users to accomplish?
# Descriptions should be short, simple, and informative.

# If your orb requires other orbs, you can import them like this. Otherwise remove the "orbs" stanza.
# orbs:
#  hello: circleci/hello-build@0.0.5

# This information will be displayed in the orb registry and is not mandatory.
